title:  "A Visual Representation of Nested Arrays"

Accessing indexes in nesting arrays remind me a lot of those multiplication box arrays we had to create on graph paper in grade school. (Probably makes sense that they are both called arrays!)

Making this connection inspired me to create a visual representation of a nested array, very much like the multiplication box arrays.

For example, let's use this nested array:
```
nested_students = [
  ["Mike", "Grade 10", "A average"],
  ["Tim", "Grade 10", "C average"],
  ["Monique", "Grade 11", "B average"]
]
```

This nested array would look like this:

If I wanted to access `nested_students[2][1]`, I would color in this box:

If I wanted to access `nested students[1][1]`, I would color in this box:

I think using a different learning modality to help process new information is a great way to promote thinking and to build knowledge. I'm definitely going to try applying other concepts to visual representations as well!

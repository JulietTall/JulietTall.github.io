To explain where I am now, I think it's necessary to rewind a little bit to my past. As an undergraduate at the College of Charleston - a mid-sized liberal arts college - I felt very grateful to have the opportunity to be exposed to a variety of different subjects in the form of general education requirements. I was particularly drawn to geology after completing a Introduction to Geology 101 course. Confident that I found a major that I wanted to pursue, I met with my academic advisor to create a plan of study. Through a perfect storm of required calculus courses and finding myself to be the only young woman in a following Geology 102 course, I became anxious and insecure really fast. As a 19 year old I wasn’t fully able to handle such big feelings, I chose something more comfortable instead. I went on to graduate with a Bachelor’s in Early Childhood Education.

Since, I have been a preschool teacher for the past 9 years and a science teacher for the past 3 years. While teaching, I enrolled in a Master’s program in Childhood Education with a Concentration in Math and Science. I thought it would help to bridge the gap between my education career and my curiosity in science and technology. While the program helped me to grow as an educator, it also helped me to make a lot of discoveries about myself. I learned that weeder courses and male dominant fields are actually deterrents minorities and women on a national level. This information really spoke to me and has stayed with me for several years now.

One of the ways we address these deterrents in early childhood and elementary classrooms is to empower all students – both boys and girls - through character strength training. With my students, I am always exclaiming, “Wow, you are so smart!” or encouraging, “Yes, you are being a scientist right now!” I’ve seen a positive effect on my students using this method and it feels good! However, as I’ve reflected over the past couple years, more and more I feel ready to empower myself as a teacher, as a lifelong learner, and as a woman. I’m ready to transition from a career that feels comfortable to a career that pushes myself.

Through the parts of the Bootcamp Prep and the Full Stack Web Development courses I’ve completed so far with the Flatiron School, I’ve observed a lot of parallels with my passion for science and education. I think I feel drawn to coding because I think it requires a lot of the scientific method and rapidly changing developments that I found so compelling in my geology course in college.

As a teacher, while I do love working with children, I also enjoy the creative process of lesson planning. I see parallels between coding and lesson planning as well. Both require identifying a goal, writing a specific set of instructions to achieve this goal, reflecting on whether the instructions achieved the goal, and going back and editing the parts of the instructions that did not achieve this goal. 

I am excited to work hard and find out what the future has is in store for me as I embark on my career change! Hello World!

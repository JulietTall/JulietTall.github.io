I found the hardest part of getting through the section on iterations in Procedural Ruby was keeping track of all the new vocabulary that was introduced. So I created flashcards to help me out through this section. Since I consider myself a visual learner, I also took the content that was presented to me in this section and used stickers to help me visualize each vocabulary word. I've found my flashcards to be helpful towards recalling different methods so that I'm able to focus less on flipping through notes and more on the tasks required of me in the labs at hand. Perhaps these flashcards could be of use to my peers working through this section as well.

So I've been feeling a bit like my preschoolers lately. I keep metaphorically building structures out of wooden blocks in arrangements that are not sturdy, wobble, and fall down. I'm stuck. I need to go back to the block cart and find the large rectangular wooden blocks to build a sturdy base with.

I have been struggling to get through the HTML & CSS section in this course. What started as a lack of motivation ("What's the point in all of this when everyone out there is using Squarespace, WordPress, and Wix to build websites? What's the bigger picture? Where is this all leading to?" turned into barreling through lessons just to get the section over with only to realize precisely 76% through that I haven't really grasped key concepts. Additionally, I don't really think the way the information has been presented in the section is harmonious with my learning style. I found it too easy to coast through codealongs without doing any thinking for myself.

In the midst of all this, I decided to use Codeacademy for supplemental practice and material. While working through a lesson there, I came across a tip that really stuck a chord with me: "Know that each brick is sound and stable before you put another one on top of it."

I know that I can't continue on until I master the necessary concepts. My wobbly structures will continue to fall down until I change my plan. My plan of action is to incorporate other resources in to my learning such as:
[Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
[Tizag](http://www.tizag.com/htmlT/)
[HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118008189/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1)

Here's to building a more sturdy building! I feel ready now to conquer HTML & CSS.
